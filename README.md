## Cybersecurity

### Attack Vectors

#### Stolen Devices

- **Threat:** An attacker steals devices (such as computers, laptops, and mobile devices) in an attempt to to gain access to logged-in services or stored information and credentials.
- **Prevention:** Ensure every device is hardened so its data cannot be accessed without credentials. Refer to [Hardening Computers](#hardening-computers) and [Hardening Mobile Devices](#hardening-mobile-devices). 
- **Remediation:** TODO

### Tactics

#### Hardening Computers

For specific platforms, refer to the following resources:

- **macOS (OS X):** A comprehensive guide for hardening macOS devices is available [here](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide).
